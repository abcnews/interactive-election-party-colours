# interactive-election-party-colours

A project generated from [aunty](https://github.com/abcnews/aunty)'s `basic` project template.

Start a section with one of the following:

- `#partycolourLABOR`
- `#partycolourCOALITION`
- `#partycolourGREENS`
- `#partycolourINDEPENDENTS`

The script will search all subsequent paragraphs for `<strong>` tags, and colourise them in the party colour.

Place the marker directly before a heading to change it to the party colour also.

This script only works on headings and paragraphs. Once it finds another heading, image, or any other element it will colourising. You can add another hash to colourise the next section.
